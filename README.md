# Image Classification of Brain Tumors
Authors: Marco Salvatori, Simone Catenacci, Simone Sorgon√†

Analysis of an MRI image dataset depicting three different types of brain tumors (divided into four classes: Glioma, Meningioma, Pituitary, and Normal), feature extraction using two different Convolutional Neural Networks (VGG16 and EfficientNet), and feature selection with Area Under the Curve and Mutual Information. Implementation of three different classification methods (Linear Discriminant Analysis, Partial Least Squares Discriminant Analysis, and Feedforward Neural Network), followed by performance analysis and evaluation of the obtained results.
